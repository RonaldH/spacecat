*Spacecat* is a [Hubot][hubot]-based Slack bot used by the teams at @vhxtv and @Vimeo.

## Scripts

* custom `karma` script -- "username++"/"username--" and "spacecat leaderboard"
* custom `stock` script -- "spacecat stock TSLA"
* custom `urban` script -- "spacecat define capitalism"
* [hubot-ipfs](https://github.com/jamiew/hubot-ipfs) -- "pin QmIPFSHASH"

It used to do other things but now it does fewer things. Thanks see you later
